## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the yellow square!"
✅ **Solution:**
- Make sure furniture is selected (cyan color)
- Press **'M'** to enter Move mode
- Look at the **center** where red and blue arrows meet
- Try **zooming in** - it might be small
- The yellow square is a small plane/quad at the intersection

### "Yellow square doesn't drag"
✅ **Solution:**
- Click directly on the yellow area
- It's at the intersection of the arrows
- Try clicking the center point
- Make sure you're in Move mode (press M)

### "Furniture jumps when I drag"
✅ **Solution:**
- This is grid snapping (0.5 unit increments)
- It's designed to help with alignment
- Drag slowly for better control
- Each snap = half a unit

### "Can't move diagonally"
✅ **Solution:**
- You're probably dragging the RED or BLUE arrow
- Drag the **YELLOW SQUARE** instead
- It's at the center where the arrows cross
